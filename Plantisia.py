    ### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

    **Q1: How does the Plant Disease Recognition System work?**
    - **A1:** The system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images of plant leaves and identify potential diseases. Simply upload an image, and the system will process it to provide a prediction.

    **Q2: What types of plant diseases can the system detect?**
    - **A2:** The system can identify a variety of plant diseases based on the trained model. The specific diseases include late blight, early blight, bacterial spot, and more.

    **Q3: How accurate is the disease prediction?**
    - **A3:** The accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality of the uploaded image and the trained model. Our system aims to provide high accuracy, but results should be verified with a plant specialist for critical decisions.

    **Q4: What should I do if the system fails to recognize a disease?**
    - **A4:** If the system does not recognize a disease, ensure that the image is clear and properly represents the plant leaf. For further assistance, you may consult a plant pathologist or use additional diagnostic tools.

    **Q5: Is my data safe when using the system?**
    - **A5:** Yes, we prioritize user privacy and data security. The images uploaded for analysis are not stored and are used solely for the purpose of providing predictions.

    **Q6: Can I use the system on mobile devices?**
    - **A6:** Yes, the system is designed to be accessible from various devices, including mobile phones and tablets. Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the best experience.
